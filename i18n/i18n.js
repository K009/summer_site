Moving from basic websites done for school projects, going through rock-paper-scissors games I became interested in JS frameworks like React or Vue. I've done some courses, thanks to which I've created more projects like RecipeApp or FavNote (checkout my GitHub). Finally, I decided to write about React in my Bachelor's thesis, within which I created a simple card game for two or three players that we call in Poland - 'Piotru≈õ'.
